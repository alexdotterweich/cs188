In this project, I implemented value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning. I first tested my agents on Gridworld 
(from class), and then applied them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

As with the other projects, I only edited a portion of the files included in the project. The files I edited are:

<b> valueIterationAgents.py	</b> A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.

<b> policyIterationAgents.py </b>	A policy iteration agent for solving known MDPs.

<b> qlearningAgents.py </b> Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.

<b> analysis.py	</b> A file that was used to record runtime analysis according to the questions in the original project spec.
