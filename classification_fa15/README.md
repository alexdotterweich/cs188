This project implements linear regression, linear classification, and approximate Q-learning. It uses these techniques with a variety of datasets and applications, including classifying hand-written digits and creating a better Pacman agent.

While most of the files were given to us, I edited:

<b> linearLearning.py </b>	This file contains the least-square regression, binary classifier, and 2-layer neural network classifier algorithms. 

<b> dataClassifier.py </b>	This is where I've implemented enhanced features for hand-written digits and Pacman states.

<b> qlearningAgents.py </b>	This file contains Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler, and Pacman.
