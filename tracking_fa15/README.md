In this project, I designed Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. 
The project began by figuring out how to locate single, stationary ghosts, and evolved to be able to 
locate clusters of multiple moving ghosts efficiently.

Most of the files in this folder were provided for me - these are the ones I edited:

<b> bustersAgents.py <\b> This file contains the agents for playing the "Ghostbusters" variant of Pacman.
<b> inference.py <\b> This file contains code for tracking ghosts over time using their sounds.
